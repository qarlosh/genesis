Submission for itch.io the Weekly Game Jam 120 (https://qarlos.itch.io/genesis)

## About the project
The project has been developed using the Godot Engine. Models were created in Blender and exported using the [Godot Blender Exporter](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-blender-exporter)

## How to play
